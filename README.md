## Machine Learning
* [Assignment 1](/MachineLearning/ML_Assignment_1/): Estimate real estate prices using **linear regression** with **multiple independent variables**. (MatLab-Project)
* [Assignment 2](/MachineLearning/ML_Assignment_2/): Development of **logistic regression classifiers** for binary and multiclass **classification problems**. (Python-Notebook)
* [Assignment 3](/MachineLearning/ML_Assignment_3/): **Clustering of the housing dataset** and the **dimensionality reduction of the feature** space using. (Python-Notebook)

## Natural Language Processing
* [Assignment 1](/NaturalLanguageProcessing/NLP_Assignment_1/): An **auto-correct assistant**. This checks whether an entered word is present in the vocabulary or not. If the entered word is not in the vocabulary available, then the auto-correct assistant suggests a list of possible Words. (Python-Notebook)
* [Assignment 2](/NaturalLanguageProcessing/NLP_Assignment_2/):Twitter-Classifier: Identification of female and male persons, generation of persons, and profession of persons.(Python-Notebook)
* [Assignment 3](/NaturalLanguageProcessing/NLP_Assignment_3/): Analysis of sentiment in reviews of Amazon products with a rating (from 1 to 5). Use for the **Sentiment Analyzer RNNs and Word Embeddings**. (Python-Notebook)
* [Assignment 4](/NaturalLanguageProcessing/NLP_Assignment_4/): Check whether two questions are the same in terms of content. Whether two questions can be answered in the same way by two different people. Model of a **Siamese-Network**. (Python-Notebook)
